Datasets, models and codes used in "Node Transfer as a Novel Information Fusion Algorithm for Multi-Fidelity Learning" by Shuai Li, Lin Shen, and Wei-Hai Fang.

The datasets catalog stores all data for the 5 fidelities, and the data has been partitioned with nested 5-fold cross-validation. Similarly, the datasets_nonmetals catalog stores only nonmetals. The models catalog stores 4 low-fidelity reference models trained on all data. Similarly, the models_nonmetals catalog stores reference models trained on nonmetals. Due to github limitations, we only uploaded some reference models for testing, other reference models can be obtained by learning from low-fidelity data. The code_methods catalog stores single and multi-fidelity model architectures based on the Pytorch package.
